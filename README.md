Foxxie is a Discord bot focused on Utility and Moderation executed in a way that is clean and professional.

The original project was meant to be a custom bot for [my Discord server](https://discord.gg/kAbuCpfnCk), but then turned into something much bigger. I hope Foxxie can be useful to you as the project that taught me to code he will always be important to me.
