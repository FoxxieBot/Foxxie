# Foxxie

A Smort Butler for your Server

## About

Foxxie is a Discord bot focused on Utility and Moderation executed in a way that is clean and professional.

The original project was meant to be a custom bot for [my Discord server](http://ruff.cafe/community), but then turned into something much bigger. I hope Foxxie can be useful to you as the project that taught me to code he will always be important to me.

If you have any questions regarding the project you can join his [support server](http://foxxie.ruff.cafe/support) or directly DM me on Discord at Ruffpuff#0017.

## Features

* Over 100 commands and 250 aliases for easy use.
* Fully scripted in English with over 850 lines of dialog.
* Utility, roleplay, reminders, moderation, image generation, very customizeable with 30 per-server settings.
